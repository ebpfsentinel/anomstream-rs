# rcf-rs

Pure Rust Random Cut Forest for streaming anomaly detection.

Implements the RCF algorithm from Guha et al. (ICML 2016) and powers
the ML detection pipeline of the **eBPFsentinel Enterprise**
NDR agent.

## Scope

`rcf-rs` is a focused implementation of the 2016 paper, not an
attempt to match every feature of AWS's `randomcutforest-by-aws`
port. Feature additions are driven by what eBPFsentinel Enterprise
needs from its ML layer (streaming network anomaly detection, SOC
triage, multi-tenant deployments) — not by AWS parity. Features
well outside that scope (density estimation, forecasting,
imputation, shingling, …) are intentionally absent.

See [docs/features.md](docs/features.md) for the catalogue of
optional modules on top of the bare forest (TRCF, tenant pool,
bootstrap, warm reload, group scores, attribution stability,
CUSUM meta-drift, bulk batch scoring, timestamp retention, early
termination, metrics sink / histogram, …).

## Quickstart

```rust,ignore
use rcf_rs::ForestBuilder;

let mut forest = ForestBuilder::<4>::new()
    .num_trees(100)
    .sample_size(256)
    .seed(42)
    .build()?;

for point in stream_of_points {
    forest.update(point)?;
    let score = forest.score(&point)?;
    if f64::from(score) > 1.5 {
        eprintln!("anomaly: {score}");
    }
}
# Ok::<(), rcf_rs::RcfError>(())
```

## Algorithm

Guha, Mishra, Roy, Schrijvers — *Robust Random Cut Forest Based
Anomaly Detection on Streams*, ICML 2016.

Reservoir sampling without replacement: Park, Ostrouchov, Samatova,
Geist — SIAM SDM 2004.

AWS `SageMaker` hyperparameter bounds are enforced at build time
(`feature_dim`, `num_trees`, `num_samples_per_tree`, `time_decay`).
Details: [docs/conformance.md](docs/conformance.md).

## Features

| Cargo feature | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `std` | ✅ | Standard library support |
| `parallel` | ✅ | Per-tree / batch parallelism via `rayon` |
| `serde` | ✅ | State serialisation |
| `postcard` | ✅ | Compact binary persistence (implies `serde`) |
| `serde_json` | ❌ | JSON persistence (implies `serde`) |

Opt out of the production profile via
`default-features = false` for embedded / mono-thread / no-persistence
scenarios.
