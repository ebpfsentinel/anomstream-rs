//! Hot-path integration primitives for `anomstream-core` callers that run on
//! latency-critical ingress paths (eBPF TC action, XDP, per-packet
//! anomaly classifier).
//!
//! The bare [`anomstream_core::RandomCutForest::update`] takes ~23 µs at the
//! AWS-default `(100 trees, 256 samples, D = 16)` config — an order
//! of magnitude above the few-µs budget a TC action has per packet
//! at 10 Gbps+. Making `update` faster hits diminishing returns; the
//! architectural answer is to **decouple** the score-on-path from
//! the update-off-path and shed low-value updates before they queue.
//!
//! This module ships two orthogonal building blocks:
//!
//! - [`UpdateSampler`] — stride or per-flow-hash decision
//!   "does this packet contribute to the reservoir?" — discards the
//!   rest before any RCF work. Per-flow sampling keeps the baseline
//!   shape (every flow has *some* representation) while cutting the
//!   update rate by the sampling ratio.
//! - [`update_channel`] — bounded MPSC channel carrying `[f64; D]` points
//!   from classifier threads to a **single dedicated updater
//!   thread**. The classifier thread `try_enqueue`s non-blockingly
//!   and scores against the *previous* forest snapshot; the updater
//!   thread drains the queue into `RandomCutForest::update` at its
//!   own cadence. Dropped points (queue full) are tallied for ops.
//!
//! Coarser `time_decay` is the third dial, but that's configured
//! directly on [`anomstream_core::ForestBuilder::time_decay`]; see
//! `docs/performance.md` for the trade-off.
//!
//! # Counter semantics
//!
//! All lifetime counters ([`UpdateSampler::accepted_total`],
//! `rejected_total`, `UpdateProducer::enqueued`, `dropped_total`,
//! [`PrefixRateCap::admitted_total`], `capped_total`) are plain
//! `AtomicU64::fetch_add(1, Relaxed)`. Atomic `fetch_add` is
//! wrapping by definition — `profile.release.overflow-checks` does
//! not apply to atomic operations, so no panic can occur at
//! wrap-around. At `10 Gpps` sustained load a `u64` wraps in
//! roughly 58 years, well past any realistic deployment lifetime.
//! Export-and-reset cadence is therefore only needed when an
//! operator wants fine-grained delta metrics; no correctness
//! pressure exists to call `*_total_reset` at any particular
//! frequency.
//!
//! # Example: classifier + updater split
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use anomstream_core::{ForestBuilder, hot_path};
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! let mut forest = ForestBuilder::<16>::new()
//!     .num_trees(100)
//!     .sample_size(256)
//!     .seed(42)
//!     .build()?;
//!
//! let (producer, mut consumer) = hot_path::update_channel::<16>(4096);
//! let sampler = hot_path::UpdateSampler::new(8); // 1/8 per-flow
//!
//! // Updater thread.
//! thread::spawn(move || loop {
//!     let (ingested, errors) = consumer.try_drain(|p| forest.update(p));
//!     if ingested == 0 && errors == 0 {
//!         std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(1));
//!     }
//! });
